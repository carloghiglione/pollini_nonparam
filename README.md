### Abstract
The goal of this project is to investigate the **high skilled workers and researches migration flows** in European Union and continental Europe. 

This analysis is of high interest because this phenomenon is particularly difficult to capture due to the **lack of coherent and widespread collection of data** about it. Indeed, there is not an international uniform practice for tracking these movements: some countries do not even record them and the majority do it without standard and exhaustive procedures. 

Moreover, a knowledge of the researchers migration flows would be of **great utility to European policymakers**. For instance, during Brexit negotiations, it was a compelling question to know the impact on the European researchers community of the hard border between United Kingdom and continental Europe, but there was not any available data to provide a satisfactory answer.

We propose to tackle the problem exploiting **unconventional data**, estimating the migration flows on top of ***ORCiD*** researchers international register.
The analysis we carry out is composed of the following steps:
1. **reconstruction of migration flows** from *ORCiD* register and collection of socio-economic factors of European countries;
2. individuation of subgroups of countries and their characterization with respect to socio-economic factors using *ad-hoc* designed techniques (based on ***Nonparametric Combinations ANOVA***) to deal with heteroscedasticity issues;
3. highlight of the principal determinants that influence flows in and out of countries, finding appropriate models though ***Nonparametric regression*** techniques;
4. analysis of the temporal properties of the phenomenon through ***longitudinal and functional*** approaches.
