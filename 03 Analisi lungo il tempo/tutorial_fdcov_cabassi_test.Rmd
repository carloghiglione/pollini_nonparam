Tutorial per il test k-sample permutation test for equality of covariance matrices.

```{r}
library(fdcov)
?ksample.perm  # the function to use
```
We import the files
```{r}
# load the smoothed dataset
load("smoothed_net_flow.Rdata")
load("functional_outliers_labels.Rdata") # the labels, 2 for outlier, 1 for not outlier
```

We then apply the test
```{r}
res <- ksample.perm(t(df.tot.smooth2), # transpose so every row is a func sample
                    label, # 2 for outlier, 1 not outlier
                    part=T,  # perform partial comparisons between (two) groups
                    perm="sync",  # do it with syncronized permutations
                    dist="hs")  # covariance matrix distance, hs is hilbert-scmidt distance. see ?ksample.perm for other ones
res

```
And graph it:
```{r}
perm.plot(res, k=2, lab = c("Not outlier", "Outlier"))  # works only if we have more than 2 groups
```
